  REGULAR LICENSE
================================================================================

  The Regular License grants you an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license
  to make use of the item you have purchased ("Item").

  You are licensed to use the Item to create one End Product for yourself or
  for one client (a "single application"), and the End Product can be
  distributed for Free.

  An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an
  application of skill and effort:

  (a) For an Item that is a template, the End Product is a customised
      implementation of the Item. For example, the item is a website
      template and the end product is the final website customised and
      deployed for a client.

  (b) For other types of Item, an End Product is a work that incorporates
      the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and
      different in nature than the Item.

  You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that
  single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then
  transferred to your client.

================================================================================

  distributed for sale.

  An End Product is one of the following things:

  (a) For an Item that is a template, the End Product is a customised
      implementation of the Item.
